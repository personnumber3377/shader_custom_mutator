- Support better header mutations aka support for example the webgl output stuff...
- Add support for better qualifier mutations... (see file:///home/oof/chromiumstuff/source/src/out/pdfium_cov/third_party/angle/src/compiler/translator/QualifierTypes.cpp.html)


- Try to rerun the angle_unittests and angle_end2end_tests binaries for the corpus since it dropped to 2k files from 7k files???
