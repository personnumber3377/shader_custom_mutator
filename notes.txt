- You should check that qualifiers ("const" etc round trip on structs and other datatypes...)
- Also add the extension includes when generating the builtin calls too...
- Implement better generic type handling in the generation of inbuilt function calls... aka do something like the following:

if base in GENERIC_EXPANSION:
    if base not in generic_bindings:
        generic_bindings[base] = rng.choice(GENERIC_EXPANSION[base])
    concrete = generic_bindings[base]
    args.append(gen_expr(TypeInfo(concrete), ...))

because now it sees "genType" (see builtin_function_declarations.txt) and assumes it can create different types for each function call argument. They must still be the same type against one another, but what type they all are is arbitrary...
